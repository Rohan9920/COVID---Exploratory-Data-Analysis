In the year 2020, the whole world came to a standstill due to the deadly covid pandemic. The number of positive cases and death rate skyrocketed in the year 2020 and continued in 2021 as well in few nations. This project aims at providing extensive analysis on the covid trends and looks to derive insights on the key variables involved in the spread of this disease. Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly have been used to study and visualize the data.
